# Miatek
Miatek is one of Yugoslavia's biggest computer manufacturers, and one of the biggest GPU manufacturers in the world.

Miatek was founded in 1980, after Kepler of America got sold to Aphelion thanks to an incompetent manager by the name of John Desirius. Following that sale, Irena (surname TBD), then CEO of Kepler of America, quit out of spite and decided to move back to her homeland, Yugoslavia. With her, she brought a few other disgruntled engineers and they formed Miatek together.

The company started by making high-end home computers, then started experimenting with 3D accelerator chips, and is now offering a flexible line of computers along with quite powerful GPUs for various systems.
