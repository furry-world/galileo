# Miatek Peony I (1986-1990)

The first computer built entirely from the ground up under Miatek, and also its first 16-bit machine. It boasted advanced graphics and sound capabilities, and has proven to be a very capable gaming machine of its time. It was also designed to be easily upgradable, with the CPU and RAM being socketed, and the machine featuring several expansion slots for various add-in cards.
