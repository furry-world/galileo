# Miatek Tulip (1993-present day)

The Tulip marked a start of the modern era of Miatek - it was a machine built for the future. With its modular nature, it provided a bedrock for building the exact system you need, as well as ensured practically infinite upgradability. It was also the first machine to ever get Miatek's own 3D accelerator.

This document describes the lowest-spec 1st generation Tulip configuration, along with several optional components offered throughout the generation by Miatek. Most of these components (or their future equivalents) would get included in the base spec systems later on.
