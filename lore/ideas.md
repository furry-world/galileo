- owns a chip fab, is being contracted by other companies for manufacturing ICs and distribution in Europe
- closely collaborates with other Yugoslavian companies (Kepler, iotaLabs), sharing resources and manufacturing capacity
- instead of being sold to Aphelion, maybe it directly spun off from Kepler?
