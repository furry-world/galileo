**1980:**
- Kepler of America gets sold to Aphelion thanks to John Desirius
- Irena, who up until then was the head of the division, decides to quit and move back to her homeland, Yugoslavia
- Some engineers from said division also decide to quit, they move to Yugoslavia with Irena and form Miatek to focus on making machines with a more open architecture
- Kepler, after firing Desirius, tries to make amends with Miatek
- Negotiations between the two happen, and Kepler ends up sharing early Apollo designs for Miatek to base their first machine off of, as well as offering manufacturing, but Miatek would have to pay royalties on the sales of Magnolia - this event would become known as the Kepler-Miatek deal

**1982:**
- release of Magnolia
    - based on Apollo's design, but incompatible
    - uses a Kepler K8 CPU
    - simple design but offers advanced graphical and sound capabilities for the time
        - video - scrollable text/tile mode, hardware sprites, bitmap mode
        - sound - the 4x 8x1 wavetable + noise idea
    - mainly meant as a means to generate funds for a future line of computers
    - discontinued in 1989

**1986:**
- release of Peony I
    - Miatek's first 16-bit machine, uses a Motorola 68000 (but upgradeable with compatible CPUs)
    - 15-bit color definition, supports interlaced video and bitmaps through bitplanes, also a 16-color tiled mode
    - bitplane-aware hardware blitter, coprocessor (in the form of a k8 or 6502)
    - custom FM sound chip solution, stereo 8-bit PCM playback
    - discontinued in 1990

**1989:**
- release of Peony II
    - upgraded, backwards-compatible version of Peony I 
    - CPU has been upgraded to a Motorola 68030 (in base specs)
    - supports 256 colors through a new linear bitmap mode
    - more sprites
    - twice as many FM sound channels
    - discontinued in 1995

**1990:**
- select Miatek engineers start a secret project to build a custom coprocessor that would primarily focus on 3D acceleration and could rival competing 3D solutions at a fraction of the price
- Irena eventually finds out about the project by reading what one of these engineers wrote on a whiteboard but forgot to erase, and she inquires the engineers about it
- she ends up greenlighting the project and decides to use the coprocessor in the next machine, thus scrapping Peony III and putting focus into Tulip

**1993:**
- release of Tulip
    - completely new architecture, based on Kepler's KX line of CPUs
    - built to be modular and easily upgradeable
    - UNIX-based OS
    - base specs:
        - video: 640x480 256 color bitmap display (24-bit DAC), uses VGA
        - sound: simple beeper speaker
    - optional components:
        - CD-ROM drive
        - 3D accelerator (born out of the 1990 secret project)
        - Gravis UltraSound (or equivalent custom sound chip)
    - Tulip would continue to receive various spec bumps over the years, and optional components would eventually start being integrated with all machines
    - continues to present day in one form or another

**1994:**
- Miatek announces it will be shifting focus towards development of 3D accelerators alongside the Tulip line, effectively announcing the discontinuation the Peony line
