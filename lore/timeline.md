**1980:**
- Kepler of America gets sold to Aphelion thanks to John Desirius
- Irena, who up until then was the head of the division, decides to quit and move back to her homeland, Yugoslavia
- Some engineers from said division also decide to quit, they move to Yugoslavia with Irena and form Miatek to focus on making machines with a more open architecture
- Kepler, after firing Desirius, tries to make amends with Miatek
- Negotiations between the two happen, and Kepler ends up sharing early Apollo designs for Miatek to base their first machine off of, as well as offering manufacturing, but Miatek would have to pay royalties on the sales of Magnolia - this event would become known as the Kepler-Miatek deal

**1983:**
- release of Magnolia

**1986:**
- release of Peony I

**1989:**
- release of Peony II

**1990:**
- select Miatek engineers start a secret project to build a custom coprocessor that would primarily focus on 3D acceleration and could rival competing 3D solutions at a fraction of the price
- Irena eventually finds out about the project by reading what one of these engineers wrote on a whiteboard but forgot to erase, and she inquires the engineers about it
- she ends up greenlighting the project and decides to use the coprocessor in the next machine, thus scrapping Peony III and putting focus into Tulip

**1993:**
- release of Tulip

**1994:**
- Miatek announces it will be shifting focus towards development of 3D accelerators alongside the Tulip line, effectively announcing the discontinuation the Peony line
